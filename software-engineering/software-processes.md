Most Software Processes are more or less Hybrids, so to avoid disagreement, the processes will be represented as is.

- [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) — a lean method that relies heavily on the usage of a project board, and good communication.
- [SCRUM](https://www.scrumguides.org) — an agile process that works in concentrated chunks of time (sprints), and has well-defined roles for project members.
- [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) — a linear process with strict phases.
- Rapid Development Waterfall
- [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org) — an agile process that emphasized pair programming and customer satisfaction.
- ScrumFall
- [V-Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model_(software_development)) — a hybrid considered an extension of the waterfall model, that has more blurry phases.
- [Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model) — a risk-driven combined linear-iterative framework, that adopts elements from the incremental, waterfall and evolutionary prototyping model.
- [Evolutionary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-evolutionary-model/) — an iterative and incremental framework, relevant for larger projects.
- [Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process) — an software development process framework, with a heavy focus on UML.
  - [Rational Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process) — a specific implementation of the Unified Process.
- [Prototyping](https://www.guru99.com/software-engineering-prototyping-model.html) — an iterative and incremental framework that puts great focus on evolutionary prototyping.
- [Rapid application development (RAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) — an iterative and incremental framework that puts a larger focus on being practical rather than using valuable time on planning, design, and documentation.
- [Component-Based Software Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering) — an iterative and incremental framework, that is adapted to Component-Based Programming.
