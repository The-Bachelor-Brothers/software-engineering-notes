# software-engineering-notes

This project consolidates notes relevant for software engineers, developers, project managers and more, with a focus on providing up-to-date information on key subjects for specifically software engineers.

The project is maintained by this organization, but PR's, issues and discussions are very welcome.

The project can be found on it's own [GitHub Page](https://the-bachelor-brothers.github.io/software-engineering-notes/), where it has been built with Jekyll and the wonderful Minimal Mistakes theme.

Because we, the maintainers, are active students, and at times find ourselves quite busy, the project might experience idle times. However notes will be taken, and when they reach an acceptable quality, they will be shared here.
