## Software Metrics

- [ABC Software Metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Software_Metric) — an ABC score as a triplet of values that represent the size of a set of source code statements.
- Bugs per line of code — self-explanatory
- [Code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) — The degree to how much source code of a program that is covered by automated tests.
- [Cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)) — The degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.
- Comment density — a metric decided by either line count or character count in regards to comments.
- [Connascence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connascence) — a metric on the complexity caused by dependency relationships (similar to software coupling, but it is not the same).
- [Constructive Cost Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO) — a procedural software cost estimation model.
- [Coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)) — The degree of interdependence between software modules; a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are; the strength of the relationships between modules.
- [Cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity) — a metric used to indicate the complexity of a program defined by the amounts of linearly independent paths through the program.
- Defect density — defects found in a component
- Defect potential — expected number of defects in a particular component
- [Defect removal rate](https://swtestingconcepts.wordpress.com/test-metrics/defect-removal-efficiency/) — a measure of a development team's ability to remove defects prior to release.
- [DSQI (design structure quality index)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSQI) — a metric to indicate a computer program's design structure and the efficiency of its modules (a value from 0 to 1).
- [Function Points and Automated Function Points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_point) — a metric to express the amount of business functionality an information system provides to a user.
- [Halstead Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures) — metrics to identify measurable properties of software and the relations between them.
- [Instruction path length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_path_length) — the number of machine code instructions required to execute a section of a computer program.
- [Maintainability index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability#Software_engineering) — a measure of the ease with which a product can be maintained.
- [Number of lines of code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code) — a metric to measure the size of a computer program.
- [Program execution time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_(program_lifecycle_phase)) — a measure of time when the CPU is executing the machine code for a given instruction/method/program.
- [Program load time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(computing)) — a measure of the time it takes to load a program.
- [Program size (binary)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file) — the size of a program in bytes.
- [Weighted Micro Function Points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_Micro_Function_Points) — a successor to the maintainability index, cyclomatic complexity, function points, Halstead complexity, and the Constructive Cost Model. It is a metric that measures the overall code complexity and volume metrics in a given system.
- [CISQ automated quality characteristics](https://content.castsoftware.com/cisq-specification-for-automated-quality-characteristic-measures) — an automated measurement of four Software Quality Characteristics. Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Security, and Maintainability.

## API Design

- [Representational State Transfer (REST)](https://restfulapi.net) — A stateless architecture for data transfer that is dependent on hypermedia.
  - [Awesome REST API](https://github.com/Kikobeats/awesome-api)
- [gRPC](https://grpc.io) — A nimble and lightweight system for requesting data.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) — An approach wherein the user defines the expected data and format of that data.
- [Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) — Data updates to be served automatically, rather than requested.
