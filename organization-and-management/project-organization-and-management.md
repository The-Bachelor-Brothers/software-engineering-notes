# Project Organization and Management


## Project Life Cycles

- [Defining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management#Initiating) — the phase wherein the nature and scope of the project is determined.
- [Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management#Planning) — the phase where planning of time, cost and resources are done adequately to estimate the work needed and to effectively manage risk during project execution.
- [Executing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management#Executing) — the phase where execution/implementatiom of the plan is done.
- [Closing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management#Closing) — the formal acceptance of the project and the ending thereof.

### The Defining Life Cycle

Tools:

- [Requirements Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis) — a process of (1) Eliciting Requirements, (2) Analyzing Requirements and (3) Recording Requirements.
  - Requirements Workshops
- [Financial Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analysis) — an assessment of the viability, stability, and profitability of a business, sub-business or project.
- [Stakeholder Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_analysis) — the process of assessing a system and potential changes to it as they relate to relevant and interested parties.
- [The Scope Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle) — a model of the constraints of project management.
- [Conditions of Satisfaction/Acceptance Criteria](https://project-management-knowledge.com/definitions/a/acceptance-criteria/) — a list of conditions that must be met before a project has been considered completed and the project deliverables can and will be accepted by the assigning party.
- [Brainstorming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming) — a group creativity technique by which efforts are made to find a conclusion for a specific problem by gathering a list of ideas spontaneously contributed by its members.
- [Interviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview) — a structured conversation where one participant asks questions, and the other provides answers.
- [Meetings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeting) — when two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal or business setting.
  - [Project Scoping Meeting](https://blog.elpassion.com/how-to-speed-up-product-launch-with-scoping-session-9ff1b2d1d6bb) — a process in which a group of experts breaks your idea down into parts and provides crucial insights on how to build it.
- [Prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping) — the activity of creating prototypes for/of software applications.

Deliverables:

- [Project Overview Statement](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-software-project/9780764596360/9780764596360_ch04lev1sec4.html) — the baseline for a project, that describes the problem, goals, objectives, success criteria, risks and more.
- [Work Breakdown Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure) — a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project, process or anything else really, where the thing is broken into smaller components.
  - [Product Breakdown Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_breakdown_structure) — a breakdown structure of the product that precedes the work breakdown structure.
- [Responsibility Assignment Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) — a chart that describes the participation by various roles in completing tasks or deliverables.
- [Tentative Project Schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_plan) — a tentative plan that shows when project objectives are to be achieved fx. a [Gannt Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart)
- [Project Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_charter) — a statement of the scope, objectives, and participants in a project.
- [SWOT Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) — a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to business competition or project planning.

## Project Management Life Cycles (PMLC)

- [Traditional](https://www.cs.uct.ac.za/mit_notes/human_computer_interaction/htmls/ch03s04.html)
  - Linear — a model with a linear process where a completed phase is never visited again.
  - [Incremental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model) — a model with a focus on implementing and testing incrementally.
- [Agile](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-agile-software-development/)
  - [Iterative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design) — a model with a cyclic process where phases are repeated.
  - Adaptive
- Extreme
- Hybrid

## Responsibility Assignment Models

- [RACI Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) — an approach that works well for smaller teams. On larger teams in can be used on teams instead of individuals

## Estimation

- [Types of Costs](http://textbook.stpauls.br/Business_Textbook/Operations_management_student/page_28.htm) — a general categorization of the different types of costs to take into accoint when estimating a project.

### Types of Estimates

- Top-down estimates
- Bottom-up estimates

### Estimation Techniques

- [COCOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO) — an algorithmic estimation technique that requires much data, but has clear results.
- [Expert Judgement](https://www.projectmanagement.com/wikis/344587/Expert-judgment) — a non-algorithmic estimation technique that depon on an expertm but has fast prediction and is very adaptable.
- Function Point — an algorithmic estimation technique, that is hard to do, language free and with good results.
- Analogy — a non-algorithmic estimation technique that requires past knowledge of the problem at hand.
- Neural Networks — a non-algorithmic estimation technique that depends on large data, but with very consistent results.
- Fuzzy — a non-algorithmic estimation technique that is hard to use effectively, but no training is required and it is flexible.

## Project Lead Approaches

- [Socio-Technical Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system) — an approach to complex organizational work design that recognizes the interaction between people and technology in workplaces.
